<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">One should hold one&#39;s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The goal of life is to know Krsna, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Paramatma, the four-handed Visnu form. The <span class="Italic">yoga </span>process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Visnu, and not for any other purpose. The localized Visnu-murti is the plenary representation of Krsna dwelling within one&#39;s heart. One who has no program to realize this Visnu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-<span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice and is certainly wasting his time. Krsna is the ultimate goal of life, and the Visnu-murti situated in one&#39;s heart is the object of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice. To realize this Visnu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called <span class="Italic">yoga</span> class and thus become a <span class="Italic">yogi</span>. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yajnavalkya it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">karmana manasa vaca sarvavasthasu sarvada<br class="calibre4"/>sarvatra maithuna-tyago brahmacaryam pracaksate.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"The vow of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind-at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places." No one can perform correct <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice through sex indulgence. <span class="Italic">Brahmacarya</span> is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the <span class="Italic">guru-kula, </span>or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming <span class="Italic">brahmacaris. </span>Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>whether it be <span class="Italic">dhyana, jnana </span>or <span class="Italic">bhakti. </span>One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called <span class="Italic">brahmacari. </span>Such a restrained householder <span class="Italic">brahmacari </span>may be accepted in the <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>school, but the <span class="Italic">jnana </span>and <span class="Italic">dhyana </span>schools do not admit even householder <span class="Italic">brahmacaris. </span>They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>school, a householder <span class="Italic">brahmacari</span> is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">visaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah<br class="calibre4"/>rasa-varjam raso &#39;py asya param drstva nivartate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Vigatabhih. </span>One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Krsna consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Krsna. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>says, <span class="Italic">bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah syad isad apetasya viparyayo &#39;smrtih: </span>Krsna consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Krsna conscious. And since the ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice is to see the Lord within, a Krsna conscious person is already the best of all <span class="Italic">yogis. </span>The principles of the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called <span class="Italic">yoga </span>societies.</div>
