<div class="Translation">For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success. That is My opinion.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice <span class="Italic">yoga </span>while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it. Similarly, <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in Krsna consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A Krsna conscious person easily achieves the result of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice without separate endeavor, but a <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming Krsna conscious.</div>
