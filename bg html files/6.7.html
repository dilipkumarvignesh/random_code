<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone&#39;s heart as Paramatma. When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one&#39;s mind is controlled through one of the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one&#39;s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramatma or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Krsna consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical <span class="Italic">samadhi, </span>or absorption in the Supreme.</div>
