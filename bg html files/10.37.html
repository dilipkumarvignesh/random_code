<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vasudeva is the immediate expansion of Krsna. Both Lord Krsna and Baladeva appear as the sons of Vasudeva. Amongst the sons of Pandu, Arjuna is famous and valiant. Indeed, he is the best of men and therefore represents Krsna. Among the <span class="Italic">munis, </span>or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyasa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of Kali. And Vyasa is also known as an incarnation of Krsna; therefore Vyasa also represents Krsna. <span class="Italic">Kavis </span>are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the <span class="Italic">kavis, </span>Usana was the spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing, political and spiritual in every way. Thus Usana is another representative of the opulence of Krsna.</div>
