<div class="Normal-Level">Generally it is advised that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand Krsna nor <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>Those who do not accept Krsna as He is and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>as it is should not try to explain <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>whimsically and become offenders. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
