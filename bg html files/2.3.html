<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna was addressed as the "son of Prtha," who happened to be the sister of Krsna&#39;s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Krsna. If the son of a <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>declines to fight, he is a <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>in name only, and if the son of a <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>acts impiously, he is a <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>in name only. Such <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>and <span class="Italic">brahmanas </span>are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Krsna did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a <span class="Italic">ksatriya. </span>Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Krsna, and Krsna was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore Krsna said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhisma and his relatives, but Krsna considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of Krsna.</div>
