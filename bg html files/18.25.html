<div class="Normal-Level">One has to give account of one&#39;s actions to the state or to the agents of the Supreme Lord called the Yamadutas. Irresponsible work is distraction because it destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction. It is often based on violence and is distressing to other living entities. Such irresponsible work is carried out in the light of one&#39;s personal experience. This is called illusion. And all such illusory work is a product of the mode of ignorance.</div>
