<div class="Normal-Level">From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider Krsna to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita (isvarah paramah krsnah); </span>He is the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are many <span class="Italic">isvaras, </span>controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita </span>it is said that Krsna is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world, but Krsna is the supreme controller <span class="Italic">(isvarah paramah krsnah), </span>and His body is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ananda, </span>non-material.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here <span class="Italic">manusim </span>because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna&#39;s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruksetra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ananda-vigraha</span>-eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also <span class="Italic">(sac-cid-ananda-rupaya krsnaya):</span> "I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge." There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. <span class="Italic">Tam ekam govindam: </span>"You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows." <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ananda-vigraham: </span>"And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Krsna&#39;s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>who deride Krsna as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Sri Krsna is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called <span class="Italic">mudha, </span>for only foolish persons consider Krsna to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that Krsna&#39;s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that Krsna has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places <span class="Italic">(mama maya duratyaya), </span>He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Krsna can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Krsna is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His <span class="Italic">yogam aisvaram, </span>His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Krsna, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Krsna consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord&#39;s appearance as a human being. But if we consult <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>and <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam, </span>the authoritative texts for understanding the science of Krsna, then we can understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam, </span>First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages inquire about the activities of Krsna, it is stated that His appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Krsna performed while He was present on this earth. When Krsna appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. His appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Gita </span>also it is stated, <span class="Italic">tenaiva rupena </span>etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when Krsna was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All these different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Some of those who deride Krsna, who are infected with the Mayavadi philosophy, quote the following verse from the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>to prove that Krsna is just an ordinary man: <span class="Italic">aham sarvesu bhutesu bhutatmavasthitah sada: </span>"The Supreme is present in every living entity." (<span class="Italic">Bhag. </span>3.29.21)<span class="Italic"> </span>We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaisnava <span class="Italic">acaryas </span>like Jiva Gosvami instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Krsna. Jiva Gosvami, commenting on this verse, says that Krsna, in His plenary expansion as Paramatma, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the <span class="Italic">arca-murti, </span>the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Jiva Gosvami warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that Krsna is present in everyone&#39;s heart as Paramatma; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the Paramatma dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Krsna consciousness knows that although Krsna is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita. </span>Although His personal abode is Goloka Vrndavana and He is always staying there, still, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion, He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.</div>
