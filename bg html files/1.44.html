<div class="Normal-Level">Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of one&#39;s own brother, father, or mother. There are many such instances in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities.</div>
