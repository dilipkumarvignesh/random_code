<div class="Normal-Level">King Bharata, who took his third birth in the family of a good <span class="Italic">brahmana, </span>is an example of good birth for the revival of previous transcendental consciousness. King Bharata was the Emperor of the world, and since his time this planet is known among the demigods as Bharatavarsa. Formerly it was known as Ilavartavarsa. The Emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a good <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>and was known as Jadabharata because he always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by King Rahugana. From his life it is understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span>, never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated opportunities for complete perfection in Krsna consciousness.</div>
