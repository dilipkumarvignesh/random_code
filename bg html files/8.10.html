<div class="Translation">One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in <span class="Italic">yoga</span>, it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure devotee who does not practice such <span class="Italic">yoga</span>, the mind should always be engaged in Krsna consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace. This is explained in verse fourteen.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The particular use of the word <span class="Italic">yoga-balena </span>is significant in this verse because without practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death unless he is practiced in some <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, especially the system of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>Since one&#39;s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence through <span class="Italic">yoga </span>during one&#39;s life.</div>
