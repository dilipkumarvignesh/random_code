<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized <span class="Italic">yogi </span>has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called <span class="Italic">gosvami, </span>or <span class="Italic">svami, </span>and one who is controlled by the mind is called <span class="Italic">godasa, </span>or the servant of the senses. A <span class="Italic">gosvami </span>knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of Hrsikesa or the supreme owner of the senses-Krsna. Serving Krsna with purified senses is called Krsna consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice.</div>
