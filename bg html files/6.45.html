<div class="Normal-Level">A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice. With determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally free from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection-Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita:</span></div>
