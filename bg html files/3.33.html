<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Krsna consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of <span class="Italic">maya</span> simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. Krsna consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties. Therefore, without being fully in Krsna consciousness, no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called <span class="Italic">yogi</span> or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one&#39;s position and to try to attain Krsna consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of <span class="Italic">maya</span>.</div>
