<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One who is unable to live for a moment without Krsna consciousness cannot but think of Krsna twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called <span class="Italic">yoga</span>. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. <span class="Italic">Ksema</span> refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Krsna consciousness by <span class="Italic">yoga</span>, and when he becomes fully Krsna conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.</div>
