<div class="Normal-Level">There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Krsna as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Krsna consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Vedic knowledge is called <span class="Italic">sruti</span> learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like Krsna and His representatives. Here Krsna distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, knows the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas; </span>no one else knows the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic">bhajate</span> is very significant. In many places the word <span class="Italic">bhajate</span> is<span class="Italic"> </span>expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full Krsna consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vaisnava <span class="Italic">parampara </span>it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of Krsna, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.</div>
