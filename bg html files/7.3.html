<div class="Translation">Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the <span class="Italic">Gita</span> are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga, dhyana-yoga, </span>and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Krsna can only be known by persons who are in Krsna consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Krsna. Krsna is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramatma. The <span class="Italic">yogis </span>and <span class="Italic">jnanis </span>are confused in their attempts to understand Krsna, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Sripada Sankaracarya, has admitted in his <span class="Italic">Gita</span> commentary that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept Krsna as such, for it is very difficult to know Krsna, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. <span class="Italic">Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam. </span>It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not easy. The so-called path of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Srila Rupa Gosvami writes in his <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sruti-smrti-puranadi-pancaratra-vidhim vina<br class="calibre4"/>aikantiki harer bhaktir utpatayaiva kalpate.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upanisads, Puranas, Narada-pancaratra, </span>etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramatma realized <span class="Italic">yogi</span> to understand Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yasoda or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Krsna: "<span class="Italic">muhyanti yat surayah</span>," "<span class="Italic">mam tu veda na kascana</span>." "No one knows Me as I am," the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then "<span class="Italic">sa mahatma sudurlabhah</span>." "Such a great soul is very rare." Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know Krsna as He is <span class="Italic">(tattvatah), </span>even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Krsna, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Krsna is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih<br class="calibre4"/>sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"No one can understand Krsna as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him." <span class="Italic">(Padma Purana)</span></div>
