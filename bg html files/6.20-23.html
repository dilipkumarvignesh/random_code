<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The stage of perfection is called trance, or samadhi, when one&#39;s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This is characterized by one&#39;s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">By practice of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or <span class="Italic">samadhi </span>which means that the <span class="Italic">yogi </span>realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. <span class="Italic">Yoga </span>practice is more or less based on the principles of the Patanjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patanjali system of <span class="Italic">yoga. </span>There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patanjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure-realized through transcendental senses-is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Patanjali Muni, the famous exponent of the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system. The great sage declares in his <span class="Italic">Yoga-sutras: purusartha-sunyanam gunanam pratiprasavah kaivalyam svarupa-pratistha va citi-saktir iti.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This <span class="Italic">citi-sakti, </span>or internal potency, is transcendental. <span class="Italic">Purusartha </span>means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the Supreme" is called <span class="Italic">kaivalyam </span>by<span class="Italic"> </span>the monist. But according to Patanjali, this <span class="Italic">kaivalyam</span> is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called <span class="Italic">ceto-darpana-marjanam</span>, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This "clearance" is actually liberation, or <span class="Italic">bhava-mahadavagni-nirvapanam. </span>The theory of <span class="Italic">nirvana-</span>also preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>this is called <span class="Italic">svarupena vyavasthitih. </span>The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>also confirms this situation in this verse.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After <span class="Italic">nirvana, </span>or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Krsna consciousness. In the words of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam, svarupena vyavasthitih: </span>this is the "real life of the living entity." <span class="Italic">Maya</span>, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patanjali also accepts this by his words <span class="Italic">kaivalyam svarupa-pratistha va citi-saktir iti. </span>This <span class="Italic">citi-sakti </span>or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutras </span>as <span class="Italic">anandamayo &#39;bhyasat. </span>This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga </span>will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">samadhi, </span>called <span class="Italic">samprajnata-samadhi </span>and <span class="Italic">asamprajnata-samadhi. </span>When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called <span class="Italic">samprajnata-samadhi. </span>In the <span class="Italic">asamprajnata-samadhi </span>there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the <span class="Italic">yogi</span> is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the <span class="Italic">yogi</span> is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today&#39;s so-called <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A <span class="Italic">yogi</span> indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those <span class="Italic">yogis </span>who are attracted by the <span class="Italic">siddhis </span>(perfections) in the process of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>are not perfectly situated. If the <span class="Italic">yogis </span>are attracted by the by-products of <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or <span class="Italic">siddhis </span>should know that the aim of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is lost in that way.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The best practice of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>in this age is Krsna consciousness, which is not baffling. A Krsna conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing <span class="Italic">hatha-yoga, dhyana-yoga, </span>and <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga, </span>but there is no such problem in executing <span class="Italic">karma-yoga </span>or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>or in Krsna consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Krsna consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Krsna consciousness or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, agamapayino &#39;nityas tams titiksasva bharata. </span>He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice.</div>
