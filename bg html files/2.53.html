<div class="Normal-Level">To say that one is in <span class="Italic">samadhi </span>is to say that one has fully realized Krsna consciousness; that is, one in full <span class="Italic">samadhi </span>has realized Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of Krsna and that one&#39;s only business is to discharge one&#39;s duties in Krsna consciousness. A Krsna conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In Krsna consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Krsna, and thus all directions from Krsna may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of Krsna or His representative, the spiritual master.</div>
