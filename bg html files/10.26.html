<div class="Normal-Level">The fig tree (<span class="Italic">asvattha</span>) is<span class="Italic"> </span>one of the most beautiful and highest trees, and people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. Amongst the demigods they also worship Narada, who is considered the greatest devotee in the universe. Thus he is the representation of Krsna as a devotee. The Gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and among them the best singer is Citraratha. Amongst the perpetually living entities, Kapila is considered an incarnation of Krsna, and His philosophy is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam. </span>Later on another Kapila became famous, but his philosophy was atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of difference between them.</div>
