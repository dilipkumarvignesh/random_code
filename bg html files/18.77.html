<div class="Normal-Level">It appears that Sanjaya also, by the grace of Vyasa, could see the universal form of Krsna exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord Krsna never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of Krsna when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vyasa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Krsna. Vyasa disclosed this to his disciple, Sanjaya, who remembered that wonderful form of Krsna exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.</div>
