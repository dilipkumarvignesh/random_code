<div class="Normal-Level">In this verse the description of <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>clearly given. The first sign of the <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called <span class="Italic">daivim prakrtim, </span>divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way-by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead-one attains to the stage of great soul, <span class="Italic">mahatma.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>does not divert his attention to anything outside Krsna because he knows perfectly well that Krsna is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a <span class="Italic">mahatma,</span> or great soul, develops through association with other <span class="Italic">mahatmas, </span>pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by Krsna&#39;s other features, such as the four-armed Maha-Visnu. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of Krsna. Since they are not attracted to other features of Krsna (what to speak of the demigods), they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate upon Krsna in Krsna consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in Krsna consciousness.</div>
