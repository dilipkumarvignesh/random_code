<div class="Normal-Level">In answer to Arjuna&#39;s question, Krsna clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in <span class="Italic">yoga</span>. For one in such Krsna consciousness there are no material activities because everything is done by Krsna. A pure devotee is constantly engaged-sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about Krsna, or sometimes he cooks <span class="Italic">prasadam</span> or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for Krsna, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes-whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to Krsna Such action is in full <span class="Italic">samadhi.</span></div>
