<div class="Normal-Level">According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>a <span class="Italic">sadhu </span>(holyman) is a man in Krsna consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Krsna consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a <span class="Italic">sadhu. </span>And <span class="Italic">duskrtam </span>applies to one who doesn&#39;t care for Krsna consciousness. Such miscreants, or <span class="Italic">duskrtam, </span>are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Krsna consciousness, is accepted as <span class="Italic">sadhu, </span>even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Ravana and Kamsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlada Maharaja was the son of Hiranyakasipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaki, the mother of Krsna, was the sister of Kamsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Krsna was to be born of them. So Lord Krsna appeared primarily to deliver Devaki, rather than kill Kamsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the Caitanya-caritamrta of Krsnadasa Kaviraja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">srsti-hetu yei murti prapance avatare<br class="calibre4"/>sei isvara-murti &#39;avatara&#39; nama dhare<br class="calibre4"/>mayatita paravyome savara avasthana<br class="calibre4"/>visve &#39;avatari&#39; dhare &#39;avatara&#39; nama.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"The <span class="Italic">avatara, </span>or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or <span class="Italic">avatara. </span>Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name <span class="Italic">avatara."</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are various kinds of <span class="Italic">avataras, </span>such as <span class="Italic">purusavataras, gunavataras, lilavataras, saktyavesa avataras, manvantara-avataras </span>and <span class="Italic">yugavataras-</span>all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Krsna is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all <span class="Italic">avataras. </span>Lord Sri Krsna descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vrndavana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the Krsna <span class="Italic">avatara</span> is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam, </span>the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Krsna by the <span class="Italic">sankirtana </span>movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Krsna consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of <span class="Italic">sankirtana </span>would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the <span class="Italic">Upanisads, Mahabharata, Bhagavatam, </span>etc. The devotees of Lord Krsna are much attracted by the <span class="Italic">sankirtana </span>movement of Lord Caitanya. This <span class="Italic">avatara </span>of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.</div>
