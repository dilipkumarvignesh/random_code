<div class="Normal-Level">In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesa. <span class="Italic">Gudaka </span>means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called <span class="Italic">gudakesa. </span>Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Krsna. As a great devotee of Krsna, he could not forget Krsna even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Krsna&#39;s name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Krsna can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Krsna constantly. This is called Krsna consciousness, or <span class="Italic">samadhi. </span>As Hrsikesa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, Krsna could understand Arjuna&#39;s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.</div>
