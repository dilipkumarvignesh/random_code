<div class="Translation">All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the great reservoirs of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the <span class="Italic">karma-kanda </span>division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>(15.15): the purpose of studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to know Lord Krsna, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding Krsna and one&#39;s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with Krsna is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>The living entities are parts and parcels of Krsna; therefore, revival of Krsna consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>(3.33.7) as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">aho bata svapaco&#39;to gariyan<br class="calibre4"/>yaj-jihvagre vartate nama tubhyam<br class="calibre4"/>tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur arya<br class="calibre4"/>brahmanucur nama grnanti ye te.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a <span class="Italic">candala </span>[dog eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Aryan family." So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas, </span>without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedantas </span>and the <span class="Italic">Upanisads. </span>It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakasananda Sarasvati, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Krsna. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>philosophy; the best purpose of <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>philosophy is Lord Krsna; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.</div>
