<div class="Translation">The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try to.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity. The word <span class="Italic">yoginah</span> is significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called <span class="Italic">yogis, </span>and there are many so-called associations of <span class="Italic">yogis, </span>but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called <span class="Italic">yatanto &#39;py akrtatmanah. </span>Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogis, </span>those engaged in pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.</div>
