<div class="Translation">When Arjuna thus saw Krsna in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Here the words <span class="Italic">manusam rupam</span> clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride Krsna to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If Krsna is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Narayana form? So it is very clearly stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>that one who thinks that Krsna is an ordinary person and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Krsna speaking, is doing the greatest injustice. Krsna has actually shown His universal form and His fourhanded Visnu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>because he knows what is what. The original verses of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.</div>
