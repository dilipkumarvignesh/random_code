<div class="Normal-Level">It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no return is the abode of Krsna, the Supreme Person. The <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita </span>describes this supreme abode as <span class="Italic">ananda-cinmaya-rasa, </span>a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss-there is nothing material. All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere-both in the material and in the spiritual universes. <span class="Italic">Yasyantahsthani </span>means that everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is clearly stated here that only by <span class="Italic">bhakti, </span>or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaikuntha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaikunthas there is only one Supreme Godhead, Krsna, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety of names-Purusottama, Trivikrama, Kesava, Madhava, Aniruddha, Hrsikesa, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Sridhara, Vasudeva, Damodara, Janardana, Narayana, Vamana, Padmanabha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of a tree, and the main tree is likened to Krsna. Krsna, dwelling in Goloka Vrndavana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-pervasiveness.</div>
