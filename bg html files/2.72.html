<div class="Translation">That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">One can attain Krsna consciousness or divine life at once, within a second-or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khatvanga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Krsna. <span class="Italic">Nirvana </span>means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Krsna conscious, he at once attains the stage of <span class="Italic">Brahma-nirvana. </span>There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Krsna consciousness. Attainment of Krsna consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Krsna consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore <span class="Italic">brahmi sthitih </span>means "not on the platform of material activities." Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>as the liberated stage. Therefore, <span class="Italic">brahmi-sthitih</span> is liberation from material bondage.</div>
