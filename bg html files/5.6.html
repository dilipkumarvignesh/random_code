<div class="Translation">Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">There are two classes of <span class="Italic">sannyasis, </span>or persons in the renounced order of life. The Mayavadi <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span> are engaged in the study of <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>philosophy, whereas the Vaisnava <span class="Italic">sannyasis </span>are engaged in the study of <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutras. </span>The Mayavadi <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span> also study the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutras, </span>but use their own commentary, called <span class="Italic">Sariraka-bhasya, </span>written by Sankaracarya. The students of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavata </span>school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according to <span class="Italic">pancaratriki </span>regulations, and therefore the Vaisnava <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span> have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vaisnava <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span> have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Mayavadi <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span>, engaged in the studies of <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>and <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Mayavadi <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span>. The Vaisnava <span class="Italic">sannyasis, </span>who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The Mayavadi <span class="Italic">sannyasis </span>sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Krsna consciousness are better situated than the <span class="Italic">sannyasis </span>engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to Krsna consciousness, after many births.</div>
