<div class="Normal-Level">These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like <span class="Italic">dharmasala, anna-ksetra, atithi-sala, anathalaya, vidyapitha, </span>etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called <span class="Italic">dravyamaya-yajna. </span>There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as <span class="Italic">candrayana </span>and <span class="Italic">caturmasya. </span>These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the <span class="Italic">caturmasya </span>vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day and does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called <span class="Italic">tapomaya-yajna. </span>There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic <span class="Italic">yogas </span>like the Patanjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or <span class="Italic">hatha-yoga </span>or <span class="Italic">astanga-yoga </span>(for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called <span class="Italic">yoga-yajna, </span>sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the <span class="Italic">Upanisads </span>and <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutras, </span>or the <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>philosophy. All of these are called <span class="Italic">svadhyaya-yajna, </span>or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these <span class="Italic">yogis</span> are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. Krsna consciousness, is, however, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. Krsna consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotee. Therefore, Krsna consciousness is transcendental.</div>
