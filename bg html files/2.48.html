<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna tells Arjuna that he should act in <span class="Italic">yoga. </span>And what is that <span class="Italic">yoga? Yoga </span>means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight. Gain or victory are Krsna&#39;s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of Krsna. The following of Krsna&#39;s dictation is real <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>and this is practiced in the process called Krsna consciousness. By Krsna consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of Krsna, or the servant of the servant of Krsna. That is the right way to discharge duty in Krsna consciousness, which alone can help one to act in <span class="Italic">yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna is a <span class="Italic">ksatriya, </span>and as such he is participating in the <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma </span>institution. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Visnu</span> <span class="Italic">Purana </span>that in the <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma, </span>the whole aim is to satisfy Visnu. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy Krsna. So, unless one satisfies Krsna, one cannot correctly observe the principles of <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma. </span>Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Krsna told him.</div>
