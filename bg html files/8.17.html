<div class="Translation">By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahma&#39;s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of <span class="Italic">kalpas. </span>A <span class="Italic">kalpa</span> is a day of Brahma, and one day of Brahma consists of a thousand cycles of four <span class="Italic">yugas </span>or ages: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the <span class="Italic">yuga </span>lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Treta-yuga vice is introduced, and this <span class="Italic">yuga </span>lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dvapara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this <span class="Italic">yuga </span>lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the <span class="Italic">yuga </span>we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this <span class="Italic">yuga </span>lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the <span class="Italic">yuga </span>the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki <span class="Italic">avatara, </span>vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four <span class="Italic">yugas, </span>rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahma, the creator god, and the same number comprise one night. Brahma lives one hundred of such "years" and then dies. These "hundred years" by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahma seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahmas rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahma and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the material universe not even Brahma is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death. Brahma, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe-therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated <span class="Italic">sannyasis</span> are promoted to Brahma&#39;s particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahma and all inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature.</div>
