<div class="Translation">A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially Krsna conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of Krsna and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Krsna. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Krsna conscious. A directly Krsna conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman or Paramatma. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative <span class="Italic">yogi</span> are imperfectly Krsna conscious.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on Krsna. One should always think of Krsna and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called <span class="Italic">samadhi </span>or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in Krsna consciousness because direct Krsna consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. Srila Rupa Gosvami characterizes Krsna consciousness in this way:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah<br class="calibre4"/>nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate<br class="calibre4"/>prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah<br class="calibre4"/>mumuksubhih parityago vairagyam phalgu kathyate.</div>
<div class="Right">(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 2.255-256)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Krsna, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Krsna is not as complete in his renunciation."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A Krsna conscious person well knows that everything belongs to Krsna, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of Krsna consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to Krsna consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in Krsna consciousness. Therefore a person in Krsna consciousness is the perfect <span class="Italic">yogi.</span></div>
