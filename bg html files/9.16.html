<div class="Normal-Level">The sacrifice known as <span class="Italic">jyotistoma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>also Krsna, and He is also the <span class="Italic">maha-yajna </span>The oblations offered to the Pitrloka or the sacrifice performed to please the Pitrloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also Krsna. The <span class="Italic">mantras</span> chanted in this connection are also Krsna. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also Krsna. The fire is also Krsna because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of Krsna. In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the <span class="Italic">karma-kanda </span>division of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>are in total also Krsna. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto Krsna are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
