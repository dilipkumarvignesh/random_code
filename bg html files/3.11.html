<div class="Translation">The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing one another, there will reign general prosperity for all.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of <span class="Italic">yajnas</span> by the human being. Some of the <span class="Italic">yajnas </span>are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Visnu is worshiped in all <span class="Italic">yajnas </span>as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>that Krsna Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of <span class="Italic">yajnas: bhoktaram yajna-tapasam. </span>Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the <span class="Italic">yajnapati</span> is the chief purpose of all <span class="Italic">yajnas. </span>When these <span class="Italic">yajnas </span>are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Performance of <span class="Italic">yajnas </span>has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from the material bondage. By performance of <span class="Italic">yajnas, </span>all activities become purified, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ahara-suddhau sattva-suddhih sattva-suddhau<br class="calibre4"/>dhruva smrtih smrti-lambhe sarva-granthinam vipra-moksah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of <span class="Italic">yajna, </span>one&#39;s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one&#39;s very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to Krsna consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.</div>
