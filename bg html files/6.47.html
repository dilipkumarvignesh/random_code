<div class="Translation">And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic">bhajete </span>is significant here. <span class="Italic">Bhajete </span>has its root in the verb <span class="Italic">bhaj, </span>which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" cannot be used in the same sense as <span class="Italic">bhaja. </span>Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>confirms this as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ya esam purusam saksad atma-prabhavam isvaram<br class="calibre4"/>na bhajanty avajananti sthanad bhrasta patanty adhah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In this verse also the word <span class="Italic">bhajanti</span> is used. Therefore, <span class="Italic">bhajanti </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word <span class="Italic">avajananti, </span>used in this verse of <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam,</span> is also found in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita: avajananti mam mudhah: </span>"Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna." Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word <span class="Italic">bhajanti </span>and the word "worship."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The culmination of all kinds of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practices lies in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>All other <span class="Italic">yogas </span>are but means to come to the point of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Yoga </span>actually means <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga; </span>all other <span class="Italic">yogas </span>are progressions toward the destination of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>From the beginning of <span class="Italic">karma-yoga </span>to the end of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is a long way to self-realization. <span class="Italic">Karma-yoga, </span>without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When <span class="Italic">karma-yoga </span>increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga. </span>When <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga </span>increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called <span class="Italic">astanga-yoga</span>. And, when one surpasses the <span class="Italic">astanga-yoga </span>and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna, it is called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>the culmination. Factually, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the ultimate goal, but to analyze <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>minutely one has to understand these other <span class="Italic">yogas. </span>The <span class="Italic">yogi </span>who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: <span class="Italic">karma-yogi, jnana-yogi </span>or <span class="Italic">dhyana-yogi, raja-yogi, hatha-yogi, </span>etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other <span class="Italic">yogas. </span>Therefore, to become Krsna conscious is the highest stage of <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world&#39;s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is by great fortune that one comes to Krsna consciousness on the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal <span class="Italic">yogi </span>concentrates his attention on Krsna, who is called Syamasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti. </span>He incarnates in different forms such as Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha and Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of Mother Yasoda, and He is known as Krsna, Govinda and Vasudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest <span class="Italic">yogi.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This stage of highest perfection in <span class="Italic">yoga </span>can be attained only by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau.<br class="calibre4"/>tasyaite kathita hy arthah prakasante mahatmanah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Bhaktir asya bhajanam tadihamutropadhi nairasyenamusmin manah kalpanam; etad eva naiskarmyam. "Bhakti </span>means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of <span class="Italic">naiskarmya</span>."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">These are some of the means for performance of <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>or Krsna consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system.</div>
<div class="Thus-end"><span class="Italic">Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the</span> Srimad-Bhagavad-gita <span class="Italic">in the matter of </span>Sankhya-yoga Brahma-vidya.</div>
