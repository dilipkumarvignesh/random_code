<div class="Normal-Level">This verse is very nicely expressed in the <span class="Italic">Katha Upanisad </span>and <span class="Italic">Svetasvatara Upanisad. </span>It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality who is Paramatma. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows: <span class="Italic">nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. </span>The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone&#39;s heart as Paramatma. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word <span class="Italic">uttama </span>is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Loke </span>is also significant because in the <span class="Italic">Paurusa</span>, a Vedic literature, it is stated: <span class="Italic">lokyate vedartho &#39;nena. </span>This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Paramatma explains the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>The following verse also appears in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tavad esa samprasado &#39;smac<br class="calibre4"/>charirat samutthaya param<br class="calibre4"/>jyoti-rupam sampadya svena<br class="calibre4"/>rupenabhinispadyate sa uttamah purusah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti; </span>then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality." This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramatma. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavati and Parasara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vyasadeva.</div>
