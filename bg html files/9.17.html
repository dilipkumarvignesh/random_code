<div class="Normal-Level">The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of Krsna&#39;s energy. In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but Krsna&#39;s marginal energy, but under the creation of <span class="Italic">prakrti </span>some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of Krsna. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but Krsna. In this verse the word <span class="Italic">dhata </span>means creator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Krsna, but their creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also Krsna. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of Krsna, is Krsna. All the <span class="Italic">Vedas, </span>therefore, aim only toward Krsna. Whatever we want to know through the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>but a progressive step to understand Krsna. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially Krsna. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of Krsna and as such is also Krsna. In all the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras </span>the word <span class="Italic">om</span>, called <span class="Italic">pranava, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>a transcendental sound vibration and is also Krsna. And because in all the hymns of the four <span class="Italic">Vedas, Sama, Yajur, Rg </span>and <span class="Italic">Atharva</span>, the <span class="Italic">pranava</span> or <span class="Italic">omkara </span>is very prominent, it is understood to be Krsna.</div>
