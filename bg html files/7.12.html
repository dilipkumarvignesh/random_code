<div class="Translation">All states of being-be they of goodness, passion or ignorance-are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything-but I am independant. I am not under the modes of this material nature.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, Krsna, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature-goodness, passion and ignorance-are emanations from the Supreme Lord Krsna, but Krsna is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is <span class="Italic">nirguna, </span>which means that these <span class="Italic">gunas, </span>or modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
