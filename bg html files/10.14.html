<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand Krsna. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Krsna and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>As described in the Fourth Chapter, the <span class="Italic">parampara </span>system of disciplic succession for the understanding of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>was lost, and therefore Krsna reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to <span class="Italic">Gitopanisad, Bhagavad-gita </span>should be understood in the <span class="Italic">parampara </span>system. When the <span class="Italic">parampara </span>system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Krsna says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>and then only can we understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
