<div class="Normal-Level">The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of Krsna and always think of Him and act for Him. One<b class="calibre3"> </b>should not become an official meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of Krsna. One should always act<b class="calibre3"> </b>in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with Krsna. He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of Krsna. And the Lord&#39;s promise is that anyone who is in such pure Krsna consciousness will certainly return to the abode of Krsna, where he will be engaged in the association of Krsna face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of Krsna. Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to Krsna and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon Krsna-the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of Krsna found in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita </span>and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original form of Godhead, Krsna. He should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multi-forms, as Visnu, Narayana, Rama, Varaha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of Krsna constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of Krsna&#39;s.</div>
