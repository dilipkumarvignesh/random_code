<div class="Normal-Level">A Krsna conscious <span class="Italic">yogi</span> is the perfect seer because he sees Krsna, the Supreme, situated in everyone&#39;s heart as Supersoul (Paramatma). <span class="Italic">Isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese &#39;rjuna tisthati. </span>The Lord in His Paramatma feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a <span class="Italic">brahmana. </span>The perfect <span class="Italic">yogi</span> knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a <span class="Italic">brahmana. </span>That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>cannot see so clearly. A Krsna conscious person can see Krsna in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever. In the <span class="Italic">smrti </span>this is confirmed as follows: <span class="Italic">atatatvac ca matrtvad atma hi paramo harih.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father (or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being. Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies-the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord&#39;s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another. The <span class="Italic">yogi</span> sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in Krsna consciousness.</div>
