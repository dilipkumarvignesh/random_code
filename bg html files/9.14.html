<div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His symptoms are described here: a <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>not described as <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>He is described in a different way in the next verse. The <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam, </span>hearing and chanting about Visnu, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion: <span class="Italic">sravanam kirtanam visnoh, smaranam, </span>and remembering Him. Such a <span class="Italic">mahatma </span>has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental <span class="Italic">rasas. </span>To achieve that success, he engages all activities-mental, bodily and vocal, everything-in the service of the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna. That is called full Krsna consciousness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, <span class="Italic">Ekadasi, </span>and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great <span class="Italic">acaryas</span> for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The <span class="Italic">mahatmas</span>, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a <span class="Italic">sannyasi</span>, or a <span class="Italic">brahmacari</span>; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually <span class="Italic">mahatma</span>, a great soul.</div>
