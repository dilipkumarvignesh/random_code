<div class="Normal-Level">As far as the others are concerned-like Jayadratha, Krtavarma, Salya, etc.-all are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana&#39;s sake. In other words, it is already concluded that all of them would die in the Battle of Kuruksetra for joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of course, confident of his victory on account of the above-mentioned combined strength of his friends.</div>
