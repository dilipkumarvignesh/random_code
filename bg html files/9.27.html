<div class="Normal-Level">Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Krsna in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and Krsna recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krsna. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Krsna recommends, "Do it for Me," and this is called <span class="Italic">arcana. </span>Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; Krsna says, "Give it to Me," and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in furthering the Krsna consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Krsna twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Krsna <span class="Italic">mantra</span> round his beads, he is surely the greatest <span class="Italic">yogi</span>, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita.</span></div>
