<div class="Normal-Level">There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts Sri Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the <span class="Italic">Gita</span> following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science. The demonic, however, concoct something about Krsna and mislead the public and general readers from the path of Krsna&#39;s instructions. One should try to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.</div>
