<div class="Translation">The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Becoming fully Krsna conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with Krsna; and thus his mind cannot be drawn from Krsna consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for Krsna, who is the primeval Visnu. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the Supreme Person, Krsna. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.</div>
