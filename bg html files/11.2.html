<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna addresses Lord Krsna as "lotus-eyed" (Krsna&#39;s eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Krsna has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of Krsna which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.</div>
