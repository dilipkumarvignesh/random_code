<div class="Normal-Level">That the highest conception of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> perfection is Krsna consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And, unless one is Krsna conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvasa Muni picked a quarrel with Maharaja Ambarisa, and Durvasa Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a <span class="Italic">yogi </span>as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage&#39;s injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"King Ambarisa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the <span class="Italic">tulasi </span>leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become a <span class="Italic">mat-parah </span>devotee of the Lord." <span class="Italic">(Bhag. </span>9.4.18-20)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic">mat-parah</span> is most significant in this connection. How one can become a <span class="Italic">mat-parah </span>is described in the life of Maharaja Ambarisa. Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana, a great scholar and <span class="Italic">acarya </span>in the line of the <span class="Italic">mat-parah, </span>remarks: <span class="Italic">"mad-bhakti-prabhavena sarvendriya-vijaya-purvika svatma drstih sulabheti bhavah." </span>"The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Krsna." Also the example of fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Visnu, situated in the heart of the <span class="Italic">yogi, </span>burns up all kinds of impurities." The <span class="Italic">Yoga-sutra </span>also prescribes meditation on Visnu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called <span class="Italic">yogis </span>who meditate on something which is not the Visnu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Krsna conscious-devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real <span class="Italic">yoga.</span></div>
