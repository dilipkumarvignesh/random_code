<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi [or mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. He sees everything-whether it be pebbles, stones or gold-as the same.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Book knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. This is stated as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih<br class="calibre4"/>sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Sri Krsna through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." <span class="Italic">(Padma Purana)</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>the science of Krsna consciousness. No one can become Krsna conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A Krsna conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Krsna, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled because he is surrendered to Krsna. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.</div>
