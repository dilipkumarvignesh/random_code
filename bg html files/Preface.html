<div class="Chapter-Desc">Preface</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Originally I wrote <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is in the form in which it is presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita. </span>In all of my other books-<span class="Italic">Srimad Bhagavatam, Sri Isopanisad, </span>etc.-the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration, word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is </span>considerably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book in its original form, and Messrs. Macmillan and Co. agreed to publish the complete edition. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full <span class="Italic">parampara</span> explanation in order to establish the Krsna consciousness movement more soundly and progressively.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Our Krsna consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental due to its being based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is</span>. It is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the Krsna consciousness movement throughout the entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have started the Krsna consciousness movement in America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord Krsna Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya 108 Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja Prabhupada.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">If personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>as it is, without adulteration. Before my presentation of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </span>almost all the English editions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>were introduced to fulfill someone&#39;s personal ambition. But our attempt, in presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>to present the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Our business is to present the will of Krsna, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of Krsna, despite all their other knowledge. When Krsna says, <span class="Italic">man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru, </span>etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that Krsna and His inner spirit are different. Krsna is absolute, and there is no difference between Krsna&#39;s name, Krsna&#39;s form, Krsna&#39;s quality, Krsna&#39;s pastimes, etc. This absolute position of Krsna is difflcult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of Krsna in the <span class="Italic">parampara </span>(disciplic succession) system. Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and <span class="Italic">svamis</span>, without perfect knowledge of Krsna, try to banish or kill Krsna when writing commentary on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>Such unauthorized commentary upon <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>is known as <span class="Italic">Mayavadi-Bhasya, </span>and Lord Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>from the Mayavadi point of view will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Our only purpose is to present this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is </span>in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which Krsna descends to this planet once in a day of Brahma, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no point in trying to understand the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>and its speaker, Lord Krsna. Lord Krsna first spoke <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>to<span class="Italic"> </span>the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>without misinterpretation, on the authority of Krsna. To interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>without any reference to the will of Krsna is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by Arjuna, Lord Krsna&#39;s first disciple. Such understanding of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Krsna consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it offers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should know how God or Krsna is great, and everyone should know the factual position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves Krsna one has to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature, and thus perpetually one has to wander within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated Mayavadi speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own interest.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">People in general, especially in this age of Kali, are enamored by the external energy of Krsna, and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the material or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>Our Krsna consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is, </span>anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>must take help from the Krsna consciousness movement for practical understanding of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita As It Is </span>as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord we shall consider our attempt a success.</div>
