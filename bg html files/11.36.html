<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna, after hearing from Krsna about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruksetra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything done by Krsna is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that Krsna is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruksetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, <span class="Italic">siddhas, </span>and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because Krsna was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. Krsna&#39;s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.</div>
