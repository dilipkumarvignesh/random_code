<div class="Translation">From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth again.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">All kinds of <span class="Italic">yogis</span>-<span class="Italic">karma, jnana, hatha, </span>etc.-eventually have to attain devotional perfection in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>or Krsna consciousness, before they can go to Krsna&#39;s transcendental abode and never return. Those who attain the highest material planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called <span class="Italic">pancagni-vidya, </span>recommended in the <span class="Italic">Katha Upanisad, </span>enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Krsna consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in Krsna consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. When there is devastation of this material universe, Brahma and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in Krsna consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific spiritual planets according to their desires.</div>
