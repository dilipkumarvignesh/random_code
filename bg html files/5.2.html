<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of works.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>confirms this as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nunam pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti<br class="calibre4"/>na sadhu manye yata atmano &#39;yam asann api klesada asa dehah</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">parabhavas tavad abodha-jato yavanna jijnasata atma-tattvam<br class="calibre4"/>yavat kriyas tavad idam mano vai karmatmakam yena sarira-bandhah</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">evam manah karma-vasam prayunkte avidyayatmany upadhiyamane<br class="calibre4"/>pritir na yavan mayi vasudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tavat</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one&#39;s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to Vasudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence." <span class="Italic">(Bhag.</span> 5.5.4-6)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Therefore, <span class="Italic">jnana </span>(or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to <span class="Italic">act </span>in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Krsna consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one&#39;s advancement in real knowledge. Without Krsna consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Krsna consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Krsna consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without Krsna consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his <span class="Italic">Bhak ti-rasamrta-sindbu.</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah<br class="calibre4"/>mumuksubhih parityago vairagyam phalgu kathyate.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation." Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is Krsna&#39;s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Krsna, everything should be employed in the service of Krsna. This perfect form of action in Krsna consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a <span class="Italic">sannyasi</span> of the Mayavadi school.</div>
