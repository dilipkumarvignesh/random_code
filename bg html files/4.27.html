<div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system conceived by Patanjali is referred to herein. In the <span class="Italic">Yoga-sutra</span> of Patanjali, the soul is called <span class="Italic">pratyag-atma</span> and <span class="Italic">parag-atma.</span> As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called <span class="Italic">parag-atma. </span>The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patanjala system of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>instructs one on how to control the functions of the body&#39;s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system, <span class="Italic">pratyag atma </span>is the ultimate goal. This <span class="Italic">pratyag atma </span>is a withdrawal from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the <span class="Italic">prana-vayu. </span>The <span class="Italic">apana-vayu </span>goes downwards, <span class="Italic">vyana-vayu </span>acts to shrink and expand, <span class="Italic">samana-vayu </span>adjusts equilibrium, <span class="Italic">udana-vayu </span>goes upwards-and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.</div>
