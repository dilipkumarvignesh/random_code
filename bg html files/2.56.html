<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic">muni </span>means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every <span class="Italic">muni </span>has a different angle of vision, and unless a <span class="Italic">muni </span>differs from other <span class="Italic">munis, </span>he cannot be called a <span class="Italic">muni </span>in the strict sense of the term. <span class="Italic">Nasau munir yasya matam na binnam. </span>But a <span class="Italic">sthita-dhi-muni </span>as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary <span class="Italic">muni </span>The <span class="Italic">sthita-dhi-muni</span> is always in Krsna consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Sri Krsna, or Vasudeva, is everything. He is called a <span class="Italic">muni </span>fixed in mind. Such a fully Krsna conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord&#39;s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one&#39;s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in Krsna consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A Krsna conscious person is always steady in his determination.</div>
