<div class="Translation">O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me of the five factors which bring about the accomplishment of all action. These are declared in sankhya philosophy to be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in Krsna consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for success in all activity, and one should know these five causes. <span class="Italic">Sankhya </span>means the stalk of knowledge, and <span class="Italic">Vedanta </span>is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading <span class="Italic">acaryas. </span>Even Sankara accepts <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra </span>as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Gita, "sarvasya caham hrdi." </span>He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one&#39;s activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting in Krsna consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in complete Krsna consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
