<div class="Normal-Level">A strong faith in Krsna consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called <span class="Italic">vyavasayatmika</span> intelligence. The <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritamrta </span>states:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">&#39;sraddha&#39;-sabde visvasa kahe sudrdha niscaya<br class="calibre4"/>krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta haya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of Krsna consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one&#39;s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Krsna consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in Krsna consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Krsna consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive Krsna consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in Krsna consciousness is based on knowledge <span class="Italic">("Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah") </span>by which one comes to know perfectly that Vasudeva, or Krsna, is the root of all manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in Krsna consciousness, one can render the highest service to everyone-namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Krsna is satisfied by one&#39;s actions, then everyone will be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Service in Krsna consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Krsna, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Krsna consciousness. As such, to be well-versed in Krsna consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Krsna, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one&#39;s mission in life. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado<br class="calibre4"/>yasyaprasadanna gatih kuto &#39;pi<br class="calibre4"/>dhyayam stuvams tasya yasas tri-sandhyam<br class="calibre4"/>vande guroh sri-caranaravindam.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Krsna consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body-not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.</div>
