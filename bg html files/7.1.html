<div class="Normal-Level">In this Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>the nature of Krsna consciousness is fully described. Krsna is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to Krsna, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Krsna are described in this chapter.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the first six chapters of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of <span class="Italic">yogas. </span>At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Krsna, or in other words Krsna consciousness, is the highest form of all <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> By concentrating one&#39;s mind upon Krsna, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti </span>or localized Paramatma realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is Krsna, and everything is revealed to the person in Krsna consciousness. In complete Krsna consciousness one knows that Krsna is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>are only steppingstones on the path of Krsna consciousness. One who takes directly to Krsna consciousness automatically knows about <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti </span>and Paramatma in full. By practice of Krsna consciousness <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>one can know everything in full-namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One should therefore begin <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Krsna the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which <span class="Italic">sravanam</span> is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, "<span class="Italic">tat srnu</span>," or "Hear from Me." No one can be a greater authority than Krsna, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in Krsna consciousness. One has therefore to learn from Krsna directly or from a pure devotee of Krsna-and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>this process of understanding Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">srnvatam sva-katham krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah<br class="calibre4"/>hrdyantahstho hy abhadrani vidbunoti suhrt satam.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya<br class="calibre4"/>bhagavaty uttama-sloke bhaktir bhavati naisthiki.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kama-lobhadayas ca ye<br class="calibre4"/>ceta etair anaviddham sthitam sattve prasidati.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah<br class="calibre4"/>bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam mukta-sangasya jayate.</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">bhidyate hrdaya-granthis chidyante sarva-samsayah<br class="calibre4"/>ksiyante casya karmani drsta evatmanisvare.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"To hear about Krsna from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita,</span> is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Krsna, Lord Krsna, who is dwelling in everyone&#39;s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Krsna from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam </span>and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of <span class="Italic">&#39;asamsayam samagram,&#39; </span>understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." <span class="Italic">(Bhag. </span>1.2.17-21)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Therefore only by hearing from Krsna or from His devotee in Krsna consciousness can one understand the science of Krsna.</div>
