<div class="Translation">This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha, </span>or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> confirm this as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mayam tu prakrtim vidyan mayinam tu mahesvaram.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Although <span class="Italic">maya </span>[illusion] is false or temporary, the background of <span class="Italic">maya </span>is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahesvara, the supreme controller."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Another meaning of <span class="Italic">guna </span>is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself-he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord Krsna, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, can help one gain such release. Krsna, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The words <span class="Italic">mam eva </span>are also significant. <span class="Italic">Mam </span>means unto Krsna (Visnu) only, and not Brahma or Siva. Although Brahma and Siva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Visnu, it is not possible for such incarnations of <span class="Italic">rajo-guna </span>(passion) and <span class="Italic">tamo-guna </span>(ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of <span class="Italic">maya. </span>In other words, both Brahma and Siva are also under the influence of <span class="Italic">maya. </span>Only Visnu is the master of <span class="Italic">maya; </span>therefore He can alone give release to the conditioned soul. The <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>confirm this in the phrase <span class="Italic">tvam eva viditva </span>or "Freedom is possible only by understanding Krsna." Even Lord Siva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Visnu. Lord Siva says:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">mukti-pradata sarvesam visnur eva na samsayah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"There is no doubt that Visnu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.</div>
