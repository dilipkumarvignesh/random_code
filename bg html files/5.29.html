<div class="Normal-Level">The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord Krsna is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> the Supreme Lord is described as <span class="Italic">tam isvaranam paramam mahesvaram. </span>Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord Krsna is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Krsna consciousness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Krsna consciousness, generally known as <span class="Italic">karma-yoga. </span>The question of mental speculation as to how <span class="Italic">karma-yoga </span>can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Krsna consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Krsna consciousness is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>and <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga </span>is a path leading to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>Krsna consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one&#39;s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Krsna, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with <span class="Italic">maya</span> (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over <span class="Italic">maya</span>, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. Krsna consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one&#39;s practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining Krsna consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or <span class="Italic">brahman-nirvana</span>. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Krsna consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of <span class="Italic">yama, niyama, asana, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana, pranayama</span>, and <span class="Italic">samadhi. </span>But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.</div>
