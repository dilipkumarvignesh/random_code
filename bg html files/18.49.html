<div class="Translation">One can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by becoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments. That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Krsna consciousness. The person acting in Krsna consciousness is really a <span class="Italic">sannyasi</span>, one in the renounced order of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A <span class="Italic">sannyasi</span> is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Krsna consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called <span class="Italic">yogarudha, </span>or the perfectional stage of <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>as confirmed in the Third Chapter: <span class="Italic">yas tv atma-ratir eva syat. </span>One who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.</div>
