<div class="Translation">I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A learned scholar who has studied the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that Krsna is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that Krsna is the source of Brahma, Siva and all other demigods. In the <span class="Italic">Atharva-veda</span> it is said, "yo <span class="Italic">brahmanam vidadhati: purvam yo vai vedams</span> <span class="Italic">ca gapayati sma krsnah." </span>"It was Krsna who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past." Then again it is said, <span class="Italic">"atha puruso ha vai narayano &#39;kamayata prajah srjeya ity upakramya." </span>"Then the Supreme Personality Narayana desired to create living entities." Again it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">narayanad brahma jayate, narayanad prajapatih prajayate, narayanad indro jayate, narayanad astau vasavo jayante, narayanad ekadasa rudra jayante, narayanad dvadasadityah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"From Narayana, Brahma is born, and from Narayana, the patriarchs are also born. From Narayana, Indra is born, from Narayana the eight Vasus are born, from Narayana the eleven Rudras are born, from Narayana the twelve Adityas are born."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is said in the same <span class="Italic">Vedas: brahmanyo devaki-putrah: </span>"The son of Devaki, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality." Then it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">eko vai narayana asin na brahma na isano napo nagni samau neme<br class="calibre4"/>dyav-aprthivi na naksatrani na suryah sa ekaki na ramate tasya<br class="calibre4"/>dhyanantah sthasya yatra chandogaih kriyamanastakadi-samjnaka<br class="calibre4"/>stuti-stomah stomam ucyate.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality Narayana. There was no Brahma, no Siva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun. There was only Krsna, who creates all and enjoys all."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the many <span class="Italic">Puranas </span>it is said that Lord Siva was born from the highest, the Supreme Lord Krsna, and the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahma and Siva, who is to be worshiped. In the <span class="Italic">Moksa-dharma </span>Krsna also says,<span class="Italic"> prajapatim ca rudram capy aham eva srjami vai tau hi mam na vijanito mama maya-vimohitau. </span>"The patriarchs, Siva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy." In <span class="Italic">Varaha Purana </span>it is also said, <span class="Italic">narayanah paro devas tasmaj jatas caturmukhah tasmad rudro &#39;bhavad devah sa ca sarvajnatam gatah. </span>"Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahma was born, from whom Siva was born."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Lord Krsna is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything. He says that because "everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me." There is no supreme controller other than Krsna. One who understands Krsna in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in Krsna consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know Krsna properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Krsna to be an ordinary man. A Krsna conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>and proceed in Krsna consciousness with determination and firmness.</div>
