<div class="Normal-Level">Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of <span class="Italic">yajna </span>performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Yajna </span>means Visnu. In the Second Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying <span class="Italic">Yajna </span>or Visnu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>specifically meant for satisfying Visnu. Therefore, Krsna says in this verse, "I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master." However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.</div>
