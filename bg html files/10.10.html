<div class="Normal-Level">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>very significant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga. </span>Now <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga </span>is explained. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogam </span>itself is action in Krsna consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. <span class="Italic">Buddhi </span>means intelligence, and <span class="Italic">yogam </span>means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Krsna consciousness in devotional service, his action is called <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam. </span>In other words, <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is Krsna. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is Krsna, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in <span class="Italic">karma-yoga. </span>When he knows that the goal is Krsna, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Krsna, he is acting in <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga. </span>And when he knows the goal and seeks Krsna completely in Krsna consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>or <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga, </span>which is the complete <span class="Italic">yoga. </span>This complete <span class="Italic">yoga </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>the highest perfectional stage of life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, then Krsna from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in Krsna consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for Krsna, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.</div>
