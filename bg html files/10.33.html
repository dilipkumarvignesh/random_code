Without <span class="Italic">akara, </span>nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual word, like Rama-krsna, is called <span class="Italic">dvandvah. </span>For instance, Rama and Krsna have the same rhythm and therefore are called dual.</div>
