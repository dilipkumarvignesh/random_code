<div class="Normal-Level">The understanding of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Krsna becomes righteous, and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the <span class="Italic">Gita </span>from the right source, directly from Krsna, attains full Krsna consciousness. The result of Krsna consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.</div>
