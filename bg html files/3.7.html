<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one&#39;s own business and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God. The prime <span class="Italic">svartha-gati</span>, or goal of self-interest, is to reach Visnu. The whole institution of <span class="Italic">varna</span> and <span class="Italic">asrama</span> is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in Krsna consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the <span class="Italic">sastras</span>, and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living.</div>
