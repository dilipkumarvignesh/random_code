<div class="Translation">It is far better to discharge one&#39;s prescribed duties, even though they may be faulty, than another&#39;s duties. Destruction in the course of performing one&#39;s own duty is better than engaging in another&#39;s duties, for to follow another&#39;s path is dangerous.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Krsna consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one&#39;s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental service of Krsna. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another&#39;s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and should not imitate others. For example, a <span class="Italic">brahmana, </span>who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a <span class="Italic">ksatriya, </span>who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in Krsna consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of Krsna consciousness, the <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>may act as a <span class="Italic">brahmana, </span>or a <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>may act as a <span class="Italic">ksatriya. </span>In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Visvamitra was originally a <span class="Italic">ksatriya, </span>but later on he acted as a <span class="Italic">brahmana, </span>whereas Parasurama was a <span class="Italic">brahmana, </span>but later on he acted as a <span class="Italic">ksatriya. </span>Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of Krsna consciousness.</div>
