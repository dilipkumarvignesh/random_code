<div class="Normal-Level">There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>simply by devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands Krsna and his relationship with Krsna, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced <span class="Italic">brahmana. </span>Sri Madhavendra Puri, a great devotee and <span class="Italic">acarya </span>in the line of the devotees, says:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sandhya-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoh snana tubhyam namo<br class="calibre4"/>bho devah pitaras ca tarpana-vidhau naham ksamah ksamyatam<br class="calibre4"/>yatra kvapi nisadya yadava-kulottamasya kamsa-dvisah<br class="calibre4"/>smaram smaram agham harami tad alam manye kim anyena me.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"O Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You. Bathing, I offer my obeisances unto You. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Krsna], the enemy of Kamsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in Krsna consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Krsna, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>is to reach Krsna and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in Krsna consciousness transcend the limit of <span class="Italic">sabda-brahma, </span>or the range of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>and <span class="Italic">Upanisads.</span></div>
