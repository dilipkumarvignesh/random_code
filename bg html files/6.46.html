<div class="Normal-Level">When we speak of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up process is predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, </span>when it is predominantly empirical, it is called <span class="Italic">jnana-yoga, </span>and when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga </span>or Krsna consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all <span class="Italic">yogas, </span>as will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>but He has not mentioned that it is better than <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga</span> is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without Krsna consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>performance mentioned here is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse.</div>
