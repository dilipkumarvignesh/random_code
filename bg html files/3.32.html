<div class="Normal-Level">The flaw of not being Krsna conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Paramatma and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him.</div>
