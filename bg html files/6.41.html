<div class="Translation">The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The unsuccessful <span class="Italic">yogis </span>are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of <span class="Italic">yoga. </span>The <span class="Italic">yogi</span> who falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, he is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous <span class="Italic">brahmana vaisnava </span>or of aristocratic merchants.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The real purpose of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice is to achieve the highest perfection of Krsna consciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate themselves to full Krsna consciousness.</div>
