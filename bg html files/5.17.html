<div class="Translation">When one&#39;s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Krsna. The whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>centers around the declaration of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Paratattva </span>means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, <span class="Italic">mattah parataram nanyat kincit asti dhananjaya. </span>Impersonal Brahman is also supported by Krsna: <span class="Italic">brahmano pratisthaham. </span>Therefore in all ways Krsna is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Krsna, or, in other words, one who is fully in Krsna consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A Krsna conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in Krsna, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.</div>
