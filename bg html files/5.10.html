<div class="Normal-Level">Here <span class="Italic">brahmani </span>means in Krsna consciousness. The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the <span class="Italic">pradhana. </span>The Vedic hymns, <span class="Italic">sarvam etad brahma, tasmad etad brahma nama-rupam annam ca jayate, </span>and, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, mama yonir mahad brahma, </span>indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the <span class="Italic">Isopanisad </span>it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or Krsna, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to Krsna, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one&#39;s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Krsna consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the <span class="Italic">Gita: mayi sarvani karmani sannyasya: </span>"Resign all works unto Me [Krsna]." The conclusion is that a person without Krsna consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Krsna consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of Krsna and should therefore be engaged in the service of Krsna.</div>
