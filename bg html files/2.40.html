<div class="Normal-Level">Activity in Krsna consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Krsna without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in Krsna consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Krsna consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Krsna consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no profit. Ajamila performed his duty in some percentage of Krsna consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam:</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer<br class="calibre4"/>bhajan na pakko &#39;tha patet tato yadi<br class="calibre4"/>yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim<br class="calibre4"/>ko vartha apto &#39;bhajatam sva-dharmatah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Krsna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?" <span class="Italic">(Bhag. </span>1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, "What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Krsna consciousness carries the person again to Krsna consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Krsna consciousness.</div>
