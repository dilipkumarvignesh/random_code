<div class="Normal-Level">A person in Krsna consciousness certainly sees Lord Krsna everywhere, and he sees everything in Krsna. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of Krsna, knowing that everything is the manifestation of Krsna&#39;s energy. Nothing can exist without Krsna, and Krsna is the Lord of everything-this is the basic principle of Krsna consciousness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna consciousness is the development of love of Krsna-a position transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond self-realization at which the devotee becomes one with Krsna in the sense that Krsna becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving Krsna. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Krsna is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita:</span></div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br class="calibre4"/>santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti<br class="calibre4"/>yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam<br class="calibre4"/>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara situated within the heart of the devotee." (Bs. 5.38)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">At this stage, Lord Krsna never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a <span class="Italic">yogi</span> who sees the Lord as Paramatma within the heart, the same applies. Such a <span class="Italic">yogi </span>turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord within himself.</div>
