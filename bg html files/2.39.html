<div class="Normal-Level">According to the <span class="Italic">Nirukti, </span>or the Vedic dictionary, <span class="Italic">sankhya</span> means that which describes phenomena in detail, and <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And <span class="Italic">yoga </span>involves controlling the senses. Arjuna&#39;s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhrtarastra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. Krsna, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Krsna. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as <span class="Italic">sankhya, in </span>terms of the <span class="Italic">Nirukti </span>dictionary. This <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>has nothing to do with the <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila&#39;s <span class="Italic">sankhya, </span>the <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>philosophy was expounded in the<span class="Italic"> Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Krsna, who explained it to His mother, Devahuti. It is clearly explained by Him that the <span class="Italic">Purusa, </span>or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the <span class="Italic">prakrti. </span>This is accepted in the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>and in the <span class="Italic">Gita. </span>The description in the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>indicates that the Lord glanced over the <span class="Italic">prakrti, </span>or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of <span class="Italic">maya </span>or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Arjuna has already accepted Krsna as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: <span class="Italic">sisyas te &#39;ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam. </span>Consequently, Krsna will now tell him about the working process in <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga, </span>or <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, </span>or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga</span> is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramatma in everyone&#39;s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Krsna consciousness, attains to this stage of <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga </span>by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Thus the <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga </span>mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic <span class="Italic">sankhya-yoga </span>enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the <span class="Italic">sankhya-yoga </span>mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic <span class="Italic">sankhya. </span>Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Krsna care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam, </span>but even that <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Krsna made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga, </span>or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>Therefore, Lord Krsna&#39;s <span class="Italic">sankhya </span>and Lord Kapila&#39;s <span class="Italic">sankhya, </span>as described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavatam; </span>are one and the same. They are all <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between <span class="Italic">sankhya-yoga </span>and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Of course, atheistic <span class="Italic">sankhya-yoga </span>has nothing to do with <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, </span>yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic <span class="Italic">sankhya-yoga </span>is referred to in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One should therefore understand that <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga </span>means to work in Krsna consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga </span>and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Krsna consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yoga</span> is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.</div>
