<div class="Translation">Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure or external objects but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within. In this way the self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the Supreme.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Sri Yamunacarya, a great devotee in Krsna consciousness, said:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde<br class="calibre4"/>nava-nava-rasa-dhamanudyata rantum asit<br class="calibre4"/>tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane<br class="calibre4"/>bhavati mukha-vikarah sustu nisthivanam ca</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." A person in <span class="Italic">brahma-yoga, </span>or Krsna consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in Krsna consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A Krsna conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.</div>
