<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered souls do not care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They leave everything in Krsna&#39;s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, hatha-yoga, </span>etc., must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">If the <span class="Italic">yogi</span> is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature&#39;s will. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained by the Lord in these verses. According to Acarya Baladeva Vidyabhusana, the Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">kala </span>used herein refers to the presiding deity of time.</div>
