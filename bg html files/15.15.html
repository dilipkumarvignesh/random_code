<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramatma in everyone&#39;s heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramatma, but as the form of the incarnation of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> as well. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and Krsna in His incarnation as Vyasadeva is the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span>. The commentation on the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span> by Vyasadeva in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam</span> gives the real understanding of <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span>. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, the teacher of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span>. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Antahpravistah sasta jananam.</span> The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Krsna gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand Krsna. Vedic literature confirms this: <span class="Italic">yo &#39;sau sarvair vedair giyate</span>. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upanisads</span> and <span class="Italic">Puranas</span>, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand Krsna. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give us direction to understand Krsna and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span> confirms this in the following words: <span class="Italic">tat tu samanvayat</span>. One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, the understanding of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the goal of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are clearly defined.</div>
