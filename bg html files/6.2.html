<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Real <span class="Italic">sannyasa-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakti </span>means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is Krsna conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the <span class="Italic">yogis</span> who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in Krsna consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Krsna. Therefore, a Krsna conscious person is simultaneously a <span class="Italic">sannyasi </span>and a <span class="Italic">yogi. </span>The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the <span class="Italic">jnana </span>and <span class="Italic">yoga </span>processes, is automatically served in Krsna consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then <span class="Italic">jnana </span>and <span class="Italic">yoga </span>are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Krsna conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Krsna consciousness.</div>
