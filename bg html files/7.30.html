<div class="Normal-Level">Persons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsna conscious person can never forget Krsna. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully Krsna conscious person. The beginning of Krsna consciousness is association of persons who are Krsna conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of Krsna consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsna consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord Krsna. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called <span class="Italic">drdha-vrata, </span>and it is the beginning of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Gita</span> is the substance of that conviction.</div>
