<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The ultimate goal in practicing <span class="Italic">yoga </span>is now clearly explained. <span class="Italic">Yoga </span>practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no <span class="Italic">yogi</span> according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>Nor does cessation of material existence entail one&#39;s entering into "the void," which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>as that place where there is no need of sun, moon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called <span class="Italic">param dhama, </span>or superior abodes.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A consummate <span class="Italic">yogi, </span>who is perfect in understanding Lord Krsna, as is clearly stated herein <span class="Italic">(mat-cittah, mat-parah, mat-sthanam) </span>by the Lord Himself, can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the Krsna-loka known as Goloka Vrndavana. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita </span>it is clearly stated <span class="Italic">(goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah) </span>that the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramatma as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaikuntha Goloka Vrndavana) of the Lord without the proper understanding of Krsna and His plenary expansion Visnu. Therefore a person working in Krsna consciousness is the perfect <span class="Italic">yogi</span>, because his mind is always absorbed in Krsna&#39;s activities. <span class="Italic">Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. </span>In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also we learn: <span class="Italic">tam eva viditvatimrtyum eti:</span> "One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna." In other words, perfection of the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.</div>
