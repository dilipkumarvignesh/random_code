<div class="Normal-Level">It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the <span class="Italic">Vedas, </span>the <span class="Italic">Sama-veda </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">One of these songs is the <span class="Italic">Brhat-sama, </span>which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry, the Gayatri <span class="Italic">mantra, </span>which is chanted by the duly qualified <span class="Italic">brahmanas, </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>the most prominent. The Gayatri <span class="Italic">mantra </span>is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam. </span>Because the Gayatri <span class="Italic">mantra </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This <span class="Italic">mantra </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gayatri <span class="Italic">mantra. </span>The Gayatri <span class="Italic">mantra </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahma is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Krsna&#39;s pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</div>
