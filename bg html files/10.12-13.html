<div class="Translation">Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, "You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." And previously Krsna states that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Krsna. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not because Krsna is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">Kena Upanisad </span>it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Krsna has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The <span class="Italic">Mundaka Upanisad </span>confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of Krsna is <span class="Italic">smaranam, </span>one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to Krsna that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that Krsna is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna&#39;s acceptance of Krsna as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Narada is the chief.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one&#39;s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the <span class="Italic">Puranas </span>and histories. In all Vedic literatures Krsna is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, "Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles." He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Krsna. If we want to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita, </span>we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the <span class="Italic">parampara </span>system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. </span>It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Krsna is an ordinary person.</div>
