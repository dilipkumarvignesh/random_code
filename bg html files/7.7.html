<div class="Normal-Level">There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita: isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah; </span>that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord Krsna, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the <span class="Italic">Svetasvatara Upanisad: tato yad uttarataram tad arupam anamayam ya etad vidur amrtas te bhavanti athetare duhkham evapi yanti. </span>"In the material world Brahma, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahma there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The impersonalist puts more stress on the word <span class="Italic">arupam. </span>But this <span class="Italic">arupam</span> is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita </span>quoted above. Other verses in the <span class="Italic">Svetasvatara Upanisad </span>substantiate this as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vedaham etam purusam mahantam aditya-varnam tamasah parastat<br class="calibre4"/>tam eva vidvan amrta iha bhavati nanyah pantha vidyate ayanaya<br class="calibre4"/>yasmat param naparam asti kincid yasmannaniyo na jyayo &#39;sti kincit</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual.</div>
