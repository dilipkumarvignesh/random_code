<div class="Translation">The yogi who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A <span class="Italic">yogi</span> who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the plenary portion of Krsna as Visnu-with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. The <span class="Italic">yogi</span> should know that Visnu is not different from Krsna. Krsna in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone&#39;s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a Krsna conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna and a perfect <span class="Italic">yogi</span> engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The <span class="Italic">yogi</span> in Krsna consciousness-even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence-remains always situated in Krsna. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu </span>of Srila Rupa Gosvami: <span class="Italic">nikhilesu avasthasu jivanmukta sa ucyate.</span> A devotee of the Lord, always acting in Krsna consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the <span class="Italic">Narada-pancaratra </span>this is confirmed in this way:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">dik-kalady-anavacchinne krsne ceto vidhaya ca<br class="calibre4"/>tanmayo bhavati ksipram jivo brahmani yojayet.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"By concentrating one&#39;s attention on the transcendental form of Krsna, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of Krsna and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Krsna consciousness is the highest stage of trance in <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice. This very understanding that Krsna is present as Paramatma in everyone&#39;s heart makes the <span class="Italic">yogi</span> faultless. The <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">eko &#39;pi san bahudha yo &#39;vabhati<br class="calibre4"/>aisvaryad rupam ekam ca suryavad bahudheyate.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Visnu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere. As the sun, He appears in many places at once."</div>
