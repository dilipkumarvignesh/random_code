<div class="Normal-Level">A self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty, save and except activities in Krsna consciousness. Krsna consciousness is not inactivity either, as will be explained in the following verses. A Krsna conscious man does not take shelter of any person-man or demigod. Whatever he does in Krsna consciousness is sufficient in the discharge of his obligation.</div>
