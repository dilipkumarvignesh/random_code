<div class="Normal-Level">The word <span class="Italic">trai-vidyah </span>refers to the three <span class="Italic">Vedas, Sama, Yajur </span>and <span class="Italic">Rg</span>. A <span class="Italic">brahmana </span>who has studied these three <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>called a <span class="Italic">tri-vedi. </span>Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore Krsna herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the <span class="Italic">tri-vedis. </span>Actual <span class="Italic">tri-vedis </span>take shelter under the lotus feet of Krsna and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare Krsna <span class="Italic">mantra </span>and side by side trying to understand Krsna in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet.</div>
