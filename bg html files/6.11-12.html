<div class="Translation">To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Sacred place" refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the <span class="Italic">yogis, </span>the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Prayag, Mathura, Vrndavana, Hrsikesa, and Hardwar and in solitude practice <span class="Italic">yoga </span>where the sacred rivers like the Yamuna and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called <span class="Italic">yoga </span>societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of <span class="Italic">yoga. </span>One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the <span class="Italic">Brhan-Naradiya Purana </span>it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the present <span class="Italic">yuga </span>or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way."</div>
