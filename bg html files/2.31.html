<div class="Normal-Level">Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called <span class="Italic">ksatriya. Ksat </span>means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called <span class="Italic">ksatriya (trayate-</span>to give protection). The <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>are trained for killing in the forest. A <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>kings of Jaipur state. The <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>are never meant for accepting directly the order of <span class="Italic">sannyasa </span>or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ahavesu mitho &#39;nyonyam jighamsanto mahiksitah<br class="calibre4"/>yuddhamanah param saktya svargam yanty aparanmukhah<br class="calibre4"/>yajnesu pasavo brahman hanyante satatam dvijaih<br class="calibre4"/>samskrtah kila mantrais ca te &#39;pi svargam avapnuvan.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"In the battlefield, a king or <span class="Italic">ksatriya, </span>while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the <span class="Italic">brahmanas </span>also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire." Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the <span class="Italic">brahmanas </span>who attain them by offering sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">There are two kinds of <span class="Italic">svadharmas, </span>specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one&#39;s <span class="Italic">svadharma-</span>specific duty-becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there<b class="calibre3"> </b>are specific duties for the <span class="Italic">brahmanas </span>and <span class="Italic">ksatriyas </span>respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. <span class="Italic">Svadharma</span> is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane <span class="Italic">svadharma</span> is called <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma, </span>or man&#39;s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma,</span> or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one&#39;s specific duty in any field of action in accordance with <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma </span>serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.</div>
