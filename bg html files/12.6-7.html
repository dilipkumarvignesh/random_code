<div class="Synonyms-Section">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="Translation">For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of Prtha, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord-if not, then he will render service to <span class="Italic">maya</span>.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on Krsna in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Krsna. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for Krsna. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life&#39;s mission is to please Krsna, and he can sacrifice everything for Krsna&#39;s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruksetra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">Varaha Purana </span>this verse appears:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">nayami paramam sthanam arciradi-gatim vina<br class="calibre4"/>garuda-skandham aropya yatheccham anivaritah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice <span class="Italic">astanga-yoga </span>in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garuda, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of Krsna consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the <span class="Italic">Narayaniya </span>this is confirmed as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">ya vai sadhana-sampatti-purusartha-catustaye<br class="calibre4"/>taya vina tad-apnoti naro narayanasrayah</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Simply by chanting the holy name of Krsna-Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare-a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The conclusion of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita </span>is<span class="Italic"> </span>stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja<br class="calibre4"/>aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in Krsna consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Krsna. That is the highest perfection of life.</div>
