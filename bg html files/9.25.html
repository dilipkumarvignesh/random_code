<div class="Normal-Level">If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the <span class="Italic">Vedas, </span>technically known as <span class="Italic">darsa-paurnamasi, </span>which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the <span class="Italic">pita </span>planets by performing a specific <span class="Italic">yajna. </span>Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a <span class="Italic">yaksa, raksa </span>or <span class="Italic">pisaca. Pisaca </span>worship is called "black arts" or "black magic." There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaikuntha and Krsnaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the <span class="Italic">pita </span>achieve the <span class="Italic">pita </span>planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Krsna or Visnu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where Krsna and Visnu live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti. </span>This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Krsna <span class="Italic">mantra </span>one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
