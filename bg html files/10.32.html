<div class="Normal-Level">Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by Maha-Visnu and are annihilated by Lord Siva. Brahma is the secondary creator. All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as the four <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, the <span class="Italic">Vedanta-sutra</span> and the <span class="Italic">Puranas</span>, the <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>and the <span class="Italic">Gita</span>. These are all representatives of Krsna. Among logicians there are different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called <span class="Italic">japa. </span>The attempt to defeat one another is called <span class="Italic">vitanda, </span>and the final conclusion is called <span class="Italic">vada.</span> The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Krsna.</div>
