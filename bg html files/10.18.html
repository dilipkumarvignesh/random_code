<div class="Translation">Tell me again in detail, O Janardana [Krsna], of Your mighty potencies and glories, for I never tire of hearing Your ambrosial words.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">A similar statement was made to Suta Gosvami by the <span class="Italic">rsis </span>of Naimisaranya, headed by Saunaka. That statement is:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">vayam tu na vitrpyama uttama-sloka-vikrame<br class="calibre4"/>yac chrnvatam rasa-jnanam svadu svadu pade pade.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of Krsna, who is glorified by Vedic hymns. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with Krsna relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord." Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Krsna, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Now as far as <span class="Italic">amrtam</span>, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning Krsna is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Krsna. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the <span class="Italic">Puranas </span>are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.</div>
