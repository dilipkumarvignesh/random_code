<div class="Normal-Level">The four orders of human society, combined with family welfare activities as they are set forth by the institution of the <span class="Italic">sanatana-dharma </span>or <span class="Italic">varnasrama-dharma, </span>are designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate salvation. Therefore, the breaking of the <span class="Italic">sanatana-dharma </span>tradition by irresponsible leaders of society brings about chaos in that society, and consequently people forget the aim of life-Visnu. Such leaders are called blind, and persons who follow such leaders are sure to be led into chaos.</div>
