<div class="Normal-Level">This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of Krsna by chanting Hare Krsna. This will free one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in Krsna. By chanting Krsna&#39;s names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, Krsnaloka, without a doubt.</div>
