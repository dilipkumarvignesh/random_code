<div class="Translation">All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Krsna consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the <span class="Italic">sastras. </span>But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Krsna consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The <span class="Italic">Srimad-Bhagavatam </span>affirms this:</div>
<div class="Verse-in-purp">tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer<br class="calibre4"/>bhajann apakvo &#39;tha patet tato yadi<br class="calibre4"/>yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim<br class="calibre4"/>ko vartha apto &#39;bhajatam sva-dharmatah.</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"If someone takes to Krsna consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the <span class="Italic">sastras </span>nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the <span class="Italic">sastras, </span>what does it avail him if he is not Krsna conscious?" <span class="Italic">(Bhag. </span>1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Krsna consciousness. Therefore, <span class="Italic">sannyasa, </span>or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Krsna conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.</div>
