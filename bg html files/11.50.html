<div class="Translation">Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, while speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">When Krsna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, He first of all appeared as four-armed Narayana, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, Krsna knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of Krsna, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The word <span class="Italic">saumya-vapuh</span> is very significant. <span class="Italic">Saumya-vapu </span>is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form. When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by Krsna&#39;s form, and because Krsna is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Krsna. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-samhita</span> it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Sri Krsna.</div>
