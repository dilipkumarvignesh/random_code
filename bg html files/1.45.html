<div class="Translation">I would consider it better for the sons of Dhrtarastra to kill me unarmed and unresisting, rather than fight with them.</div>
<div class="Synonyms-Section">PURPORT</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It is the custom-according to <span class="Italic">ksatriya </span>fighting principles-that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked by the enemy. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to softheartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.</div>
