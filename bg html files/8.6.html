<div class="Normal-Level">The process of changing one&#39;s nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Maharaja Bharata thought of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life. However, as a deer, Maharaja Bharata could remember his past activities. Of course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one&#39;s life influences one&#39;s thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this life determine one&#39;s future state of being. If one is transcendentally absorbed in Krsna&#39;s service,then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not physical. Therefore the chanting of Hare Krsna is the best process for successfully changing one&#39;s state of being to transcendental life.</div>
